# appteam_restaurantapi

For this project, I decided to use **Flask** as the framework for building the API. I chose Flask because in the case of this project, it is simpler and more lightweight than other frameworks, making it faster and only needing the most essential functionality. For a time crunch like this, I think Flask is the best option because you can get a Flask app up and running with only a few lines of code, and it makes creating REST API endpoints super simple.

I opted to use Marshmallow for serialization and deserialization. This way, I didn't have to manually convert both objects to user-readable JSON and it would interpret user input without having to manually parse it.

This was a fun project from the get-go because I was implementing a lot of the database concepts that we have learned this semester in INLS 523 in a hands-on way.
