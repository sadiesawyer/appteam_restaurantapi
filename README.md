# appteam_restaurantapi

For this project, I decided to use **Flask** as the framework for building the API. I chose Flask because in the case of this project, it is simpler and more lightweight than other frameworks, making it faster and only needing the most essential functionality. For a time crunch like this, I think Flask is the best option because you can get a Flask app up and running with only a few lines of code, and it makes creating REST API endpoints super simple.

I opted to use **Marshmallow** for serialization because it is build to work well with Flask. This way, I didn't have to manually convert both objects to user-readable JSON and it would interpret user input without having to manually parse it. It also has great data validation rules and constraints, ensuring that users send valid data and that bad data doesn't get put in the database.

I chose **SQLAlchemy** for querying the database because it eliminates the need to write raw SQL queries, which can be error prone. It integrates really well with Flask, and it is simple to define an entity and its relationships.

This was a fun project from the get-go because I was implementing a lot of the database concepts that we have learned this semester in INLS 523 in a hands-on way.
